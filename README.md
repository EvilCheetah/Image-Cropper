# Image Cropper
## Description
### Why was the program created?
The program was created to automate the image cropping process.  
I used it to crop the image to prettify the look of the sets for DOTA 2 items to later sell the items on eBay.

Basically, it was turning this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/Initial_Image.png" href="https://github.com/EvilCheetah/Image-Cropper/blob/master/img/Initial_Image.png" width="50%">
</p>

Into this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/Final_Image.png" href="https://github.com/EvilCheetah/Image-Cropper/blob/master/img/Final_Image.png?raw=true" width="50%">
</p>

But program allows to do that on a large scale.

## Installation
### Virtual Environment
First, you need to set up virtual environment for your system.
You can read more about it here:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[venv â€” Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[How to activate virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)  

### Requirements
After activating virtual environment, you need to install requirements.  
You can do it by typing following command:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Prepare The Files
Prepare the images you want to crop, and prepare text file with names.  
The names will be assigned in the ascending order.  
Make sure that the `number of names` **is equal** to `number of images`.

### Setting Up Environment Variables
The only thing you need to do, is to copy and paste `.env.example`, remove `.example` extension from it, making it `.env`.
Then fill out the fields in file.  
`Every field` in `.env` file is `REQUIRED`.  
If there will be any error, the program will let you know about it.

### Run
To run the program, basically run `main.py`.  
You can do it by typing the following command:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`python main.py`

## What've I learned?
* Basics of `Pillow` and `pathlib`
* How to set up set up, load and check for error `.env`
* Learned to sort `paths` using `natsort`
* Improved `README.md` formatting
### Examples
Examples of `eBay` listings, where I used program:
